# üßë‚Äçüíª Authentication & User Registration

In Melody Collab, users can create an account using their email and password or sign in with their Google account. When a user registers for the first time, their profile is automatically created and stored in the platform‚Äôs database.

### Sign-in Options:

- **Email & Password:** Users fill out a sign-up form, and their credentials are verified through Firebase.
- **Google Sign-In:** If users choose this method, Firebase securely handles the entire authentication process. The platform creates a user profile automatically upon first login.

Once registered, the user can:

- Complete their profile with details such as artist name, country, social media links, and profile picture.
- Access platform features depending on their account type (Free or PRO).

# **Melodies ‚Äì Uploading, Downloading & Licensing**

Melody Collab allows producers to upload their original melodies and share them with others for collaboration. These melodies are displayed publicly across the platform, where other users can explore, preview, and download them.

**Uploading a Melody**

When a user uploads a melody:

- The original audio file (usually in .wav format) is securely stored on the server. This high-quality version will be used when other users download the melody.
- To improve the listening experience across the platform, the uploaded .wav file is automatically converted to a lightweight .mp3 version using an internal converter already integrated into the platform.
- The .mp3 version is used for fast streaming and previewing in sections like ‚ÄúBrowse All Melodies.‚Äù
- The platform also collects important metadata such as the melody title, BPM, key, genre, instruments used, and the collaboration percentage (e.g., 50%).
- Once submitted, the melody is published to the public browsing section, the user‚Äôs profile, and the feeds of users who follow them.
- Free users have a limited number of uploads per month, while PRO users can upload unlimited melodies.

**Downloading a Melody**

When a user downloads a melody for collaboration:

- A PDF license is automatically generated during the download process.
- This license includes key information such as:
    - Melody name and metadata
    - Original producer‚Äôs full name and alias
    - Username of the downloader
    - The agreed collaboration percentage
    - A timestamp of the download
- The PDF serves as a legal record confirming the collaboration agreement between both users.

**Collaboration Agreement Modal**

Before downloading a melody, users are presented with a modal showing the full collaboration terms. They must agree by checking a confirmation box. Only after accepting the agreement are the download buttons for the audio file and the license PDF enabled.

This process ensures transparency in collaborations and protects the rights of the original creator while providing a smooth and fast experience for users listening to melodies on the platform.

# **Sample Packs & Marketplace**

The Marketplace is the section where producers can sell their sample packs and other digital products directly through the platform. Only PRO users are allowed to upload and sell products, but all users (Free and PRO) can browse and purchase items.

**Uploading a Sample Pack**

When a PRO user uploads a new sample pack:

- They are required to provide a title, price (minimum $0.99), a description, and cover artwork.
- They upload the product as a .zip file containing all the samples or content they wish to sell.
- An audio demo (usually .wav or .mp3) must also be uploaded so users can preview the pack before purchasing.
- Optionally, the producer can add a YouTube or Vimeo video to showcase the pack in more detail.
- The uploaded product is stored securely on the server, and its metadata is saved to the database.
- Once published, the pack appears in the Marketplace and on the producer‚Äôs public profile under the "Premium Packs" section.

**Purchasing a Sample Pack**

When a user (Free or PRO) buys a sample pack:

- The payment is processed using PayPal, and the funds go directly to the PayPal account linked to the producer who is selling the pack.
- After the payment is successfully completed, the buyer gets immediate access to download the .zip file.
- The purchase is also reflected in the user‚Äôs personal "My Downloads" section, where they can re-download the pack at any time.
- The platform also stores this transaction to be displayed later in the PRO user‚Äôs sales analytics dashboard.

**Browsing the Marketplace**

All users can explore the Marketplace, search for products, and use filters to find packs by genre, instrument, price, and more.

- A featured banner at the top highlights selected sample packs.
- Packs are displayed in a grid format with information like cover image, title, producer name, and price.
- Users can preview the demo audio or click on a pack to see the full product page with detailed descriptions and additional media.

**Product Page Details**

Each sample pack has its own product page where users can:

- Listen to the demo audio.
- Watch a promotional video (if available).
- Read a full description of what‚Äôs included.
- View metadata like genre, file size, and category.
- Add the product to their cart and proceed to checkout.

This system allows PRO users to monetize their work directly within the Melody Collab ecosystem while giving all users access to high-quality digital products from other creators.

This flow is designed to provide a secure, smooth shopping experience for users while enabling PRO producers to monetize their work through direct PayPal transactions.

# **Thank You Page ‚Äì Order Confirmation & Download**

After a user successfully completes a purchase, they are redirected to the **Thank You Page**, which serves as the final step in the purchase flow. This page confirms the transaction and gives the user immediate access to the product they just bought.

**What the Thank You Page Should Display:**

1. **Success Message**
    
    A clear confirmation that the purchase was successful (e.g., ‚ÄúThank you for your purchase!‚Äù).

    - Order number (e.g., #MC-2025-00123)

- Encourages further engagement through post-purchase navigation.

# **Melody Upload Flow**

Melody Collab allows all users (Free and PRO) to upload their original melodies to share with other producers and encourage collaboration. This feature is one of the core functionalities of the platform.

**How It Works**

When a user uploads a melody:

- The user uploads a .wav file through a drag-and-drop interface or file selector.
- The original .wav file is stored securely on the server. This is the version that will be available for other users to download later.
- To ensure fast playback across the platform, the .wav file is automatically converted to a lighter .mp3 version using an internal audio converter already integrated into the platform.
    - The .mp3 version is used for previews in the "Browse" section and other public views.
    - This improves load speed and makes the experience smoother for all users.

**Required Metadata**

During the upload, the user must provide the following:

- Melody title
- BPM (beats per minute)
- Musical key (e.g., C minor, A# major)
- Genre(s)
- Instrument(s) used
- Artist Type (intended collaborator, e.g., beatmaker, composer)
- Collaboration percentage (e.g., 50%) ‚Äì this defines how royalties or credits should be split and is automatically added to the PDF license

**Ownership Agreement**

- The user must check a box confirming that the melody was created by them and that they hold all rights to it.
- A disclaimer is displayed, stating that Melody Collab is not responsible for any legal issues caused by false ownership claims.

**After Uploading**

- The melody becomes publicly available in:
    - The ‚ÄúBrowse All Melodies‚Äù section
    - The user‚Äôs public profile
    - The feeds of followers
- A waveform and preview player (using the .mp3) are generated automatically for playback.
- The melody can now be downloaded by others with a license agreement in place (PDF generation on download).

**Upload Limits**

- Free users are limited to a certain number of melody uploads per month (e.g., 5).
- PRO users can upload unlimited melodies without restrictions.

This system makes it easy for producers to share their melodies with full transparency while protecting their ownership through licensing and metadata tracking.

# **Sample Pack Upload Flow**

PRO users on Melody Collab can upload and sell their own sample packs or digital products directly through the platform. This feature gives producers the opportunity to monetize their work and build a digital store inside their profile.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note for Developers:
> 
> 
> This upload flow is already available on the platform, but it will need to connect properly with the future shopping cart and download system once those are implemented.
> 

**How It Works**

When a PRO user uploads a sample pack, they must complete a form with the following:

1. **Product Title**
    
    The name of the sample pack or product.
    
2. **Price**
    
    Set in USD, with a minimum price of $0.99. Free products are not allowed.
    
3. **Cover Art**
    
    An image (JPG or PNG) that will visually represent the pack in the marketplace and product page.
    
4. **.ZIP File Upload**
    
    The actual sample pack file that contains the sounds, loops, or other content being sold. This is what buyers will download after completing their purchase.
    
5. **Audio Demo**
    
    A short .mp3 or .wav preview that lets users hear a sample of what‚Äôs inside the pack before buying.
    
6. **Promo Video (Optional)**
    
    A link to a YouTube or Vimeo video showing the content of the pack, how to use it, or who it‚Äôs for.
    
7. **Genres**
    
    Tags that define the musical styles the pack is suited for (e.g., Trap, Afrobeat, Lo-Fi).
    
8. **Description**
    
    A text field where the producer explains what the buyer will get (e.g., loops, one-shots, stems, folders, etc.).
    
9. **Ownership Confirmation**
    
    The producer must confirm they are the original creator and owner of the content in the pack.
    

**After Uploading**

- The pack is saved in the database and made visible in:
    - The **Marketplace**
    - The **producer‚Äôs profile** under the Premium Packs section
- The uploaded files are stored securely on the server (e.g., Cloudways)
- The audio demo is used on the product page to allow users to preview before purchasing
- When a user buys the product, they‚Äôll be able to download the .zip file immediately
