# Melody Collab - App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a brand-new user lands on Melody Collab, they are welcomed by a vibrant and intuitive landing page that highlights the platform’s unique Emerald accents mixed with dark, elegant Zinc backdrops. The landing page provides an immediate sense of community and creativity, inviting the user to explore the benefits of collaborating with other music producers. Users can choose to sign up with their email and password or use the simplified Google Sign-In option, all managed securely through Firebase authentication. For those who have forgotten their password or need to recover their account details, a clear and accessible password recovery option is available. The sign-up and sign-in process is designed to be as straightforward as possible, ensuring that whether users are new or returning, their entry into the platform is smooth and welcoming.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Once a user successfully signs in, they are directed to a personalized main dashboard that serves as the central hub of Melody Collab. This home page displays a curated overview of featured melodies, sample packs, and updates from producers they follow. The interface is clean, with intuitive navigation elements such as a header menu and a sidebar that help users quickly access key sections like the exploration page, personal content management areas, and the marketplace. For PRO users, the dashboard also includes a dedicated analytics section displaying real-time metrics such as plays, downloads, and sales. This organized layout ensures users can easily move between discovering new music, managing their contributions, and exploring premium features.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
Users exploring the platform can start in the 'Explorar Melodías' section where they can apply filters such as Popularity, Genres, BPM, Instruments, Key, and Artist Type to narrow down their search. Upon selecting a melody, the user is taken to a detailed view featuring metadata, an interactive waveform for audio playback, and an option to download the melody. Before the download, a modal popup appears asking the user to agree to the legal terms of collaboration; once accepted, an automatically generated PDF is created that documents the collaboration details including split percentages and timestamps.

In addition to exploring individual melodies, users can browse a vibrant marketplace dedicated to sample packs. Here, a grid view displays the products with audio demos, cover art, and pricing information. PRO users are afforded the capability to upload and sell their sample packs, while all users have the ability to purchase items. The checkout process is streamlined through payment integrations, using Stripe for membership payments and PayPal for in-platform product transactions. After a successful transaction, the user is navigated to a confirmation page that offers immediate download access and sends an email summarizing the transaction.

The producer directory allows users to discover and explore profiles of various music producers. In this flow, users can search by name, country, or filter through top-rated producers. Each producer’s profile showcases their biography, social network links, uploaded melodies, and sample packs. PRO users receive additional badges of verification and enhanced profile customization options, reinforcing their elevated access within the community.

## Settings and Account Management
Within the settings area of Melody Collab, users can easily manage their personal account details. By navigating to the ‘Manage Account’ section, they can update their profile information, change their password, and configure notification preferences. PRO users also have access to subscription management features where they can view and cancel their subscriptions and link their PayPal account for receiving payments. The design ensures that after making changes or updates, users are smoothly returned to the main dashboard without any disruptions to their overall navigation experience. Administrators have an extended version of account management that includes moderation of user content, control over subscriptions, and comprehensive tools to manage the platform’s community and content.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
Melody Collab has been designed to gracefully handle any disruptions in the user flow. For instance, if a user enters invalid information during sign-in, an error message appears clearly indicating the issue and offering guidance for corrections. Should there be any connectivity problems or failed transactions, the system displays fallback pages that allow the user to retry or contact support. Similarly, when a Free user inadvertently tries to access PRO-only features, a modal window is triggered that explains the benefits of upgrading and provides a seamless path towards initiating a PRO subscription. In administrative routes, specific error states inform the admin when content moderation actions or user management requests have failed, ensuring that corrective measures are taken promptly. These alternate flows help maintain a consistent and uninterrupted user experience throughout the platform.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
Melody Collab guides users from the very first landing page through a series of well-connected features that promote collaboration and creative sharing. Beginning with a welcoming sign-up and sign-in experience that relies on familiar authentication methods, users are introduced to a main dashboard that aggregates all key functionalities. They can explore melodies, enjoy detailed content pages with embedded legal modals for collaboration agreements, purchase and sell sample packs through a reliable checkout process, and manage their profiles and subscriptions effortlessly. PRO users enjoy additional privileges including advanced analytics and content management tools. Administrators have the tools they need to ensure the community remains vibrant and compliant with collaboration agreements. Overall, the journey through Melody Collab is designed to be intuitive, transparent, and inclusive, ensuring that every action a user takes is clearly connected to their next step on the platform.
